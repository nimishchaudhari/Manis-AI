# Phase 3 Implementation: API Gateway and Tool Manager MVP

This PR implements Phase 3 of the Manis-Inspired Autonomous AI System, focusing on the API Gateway and Tool Manager services.

## Features Added

### API Gateway Implementation
- Created a Fastify-based API service with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Implemented key endpoints:
  - `POST /v1/jobs`: For submitting new goals to the system
  - `GET /v1/jobs/{jobId}/status`: For checking job status and results
- Added comprehensive validation using Zod schemas
- Set up integration with the Master Orchestrator
- Added integration and unit tests

### Tool Manager Implementation
- Created a Fastify-based Tool Manager service with OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Implemented a standardized API for tool execution
- Created a mock API tool with circuit breaker pattern for resilience
- Added comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Implemented integration and unit tests

### Agent Integration with Tool Manager
- Created a Tool Manager client in the shared-utils package
- Enhanced the Agent Template to support Tool Manager integration
- Updated the Echo Agent and Web Search Agent to use the Tool Manager for external tool access
- Improved error handling and Chain-of-Thought logging

### CI/CD Setup
- Added GitHub Actions workflows for:
  - Continuous Integration (CI) with linting and testing
  - Continuous Deployment (CD) with Docker image building
- Created Docker files for containerization
- Added comprehensive test scripts

## Testing Done
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for API Gateway and Tool Manager
- End-to-end test scripts for local validation

## Documentation
- Enhanced Swagger documentation for both services
- Updated README.md with project architecture and usage examples
- Updated WIP.md with completed tasks and next steps

## How to Test
1. Start the RabbitMQ service: `docker-compose up -d rabbitmq`
2. Build the packages: `pnpm build`
3. Start the API Gateway: `cd packages/api-gateway && pnpm start`
4. Start the Tool Manager: `cd packages/tool-manager && pnpm start`
5. Submit a job via the API: `curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/v1/jobs" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"goal": "Analyze the impact of recent AI regulations on healthcare"}'`
6. Check job status: `curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/v1/jobs/{job_id}/status"`

Alternatively, use the test script: `scripts/test-all.sh` or `scripts/test-all.bat` on Windows.

## Next Steps
The next phase (Phase 4) will focus on implementing the RAG Service for memory capabilities.
