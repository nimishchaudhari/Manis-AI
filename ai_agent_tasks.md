Development Prompt: Manis-Inspired Autonomous AI SystemRole: You are an expert AI Software Engineer tasked with implementing a complex, distributed multi-agent AI system.Primary Goal: Develop the Manis-Inspired Autonomous AI System according to the specifications outlined in the provided Technical Implementation Plan (manis_implementation_plan_v1) and the Functional Requirements/User Stories (to be provided separately).Key Inputs:Technical Implementation Plan (manis_implementation_plan_v1): This is your primary architectural and implementation blueprint. Adhere to it closely.Functional Requirements / User Stories: (User will provide this separately) These define the specific capabilities and behaviors the system must exhibit.Core Architectural Principles & Constraints (Mandatory):Technology Stack: Node.js (latest LTS), TypeScript, pnpm workspaces (Monorepo).Structure: Strictly follow the monorepo structure outlined in the plan (/packages/*).Communication Protocol: Implement and rigorously use the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for all inter-service communication via the chosen Message Bus (RabbitMQ or Kafka). Use the Zod schemas defined in @acme/shared-mcp for validation.Architecture: Implement the layered architecture, including hierarchical orchestration, capability-based agent discovery, RAG-based memory, and robust tool integration with sandboxing.Observability: Integrate comprehensive structured logging (Pino), distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry), and metrics from the beginning. Ensure proper context propagation (trace IDs, job IDs, etc.).Testing: Implement thorough unit tests (Vitest/Jest) and integration tests (using testcontainers-node where applicable) for all components. Aim for high test coverage.Security: Apply security best practices throughout (input validation, secrets management, non-root Docker users, least privilege).Code Quality: Maintain clean, well-documented, and maintainable TypeScript code (ESLint, Prettier).Suggested Development Phasing & Approach:Implement the system iteratively. Focus on establishing the core framework and communication patterns first.Phase 1: Foundation & Core CommunicationSet up the monorepo structure with pnpm workspaces.Initialize core shared packages: @acme/shared-mcp (with Zod schemas) and @acme/shared-utils (logging config, basic errors).Set up the chosen Message Bus (RabbitMQ/Kafka) infrastructure (e.g., using Docker Compose for local dev) and implement basic connection/client logic. Define core exchanges/topics.Phase 2: Orchestration & Agent MVPImplement a basic Master Orchestrator service capable of receiving a goal, generating a unique jobId, creating a simple TaskAssignment MCP message, and publishing it to the Message Bus.Implement the Agent Template (@acme/agent-template) including the IAgent interface.Create a simple "Echo Agent" based on the template that subscribes to a task queue/topic, receives a TaskAssignment, sends StatusUpdate (in-progress, completed) and basic CoTLog messages back via the Message Bus, and echoes back the input parameters as its result.Implement basic status tracking in the Orchestrator based on received StatusUpdate messages.Phase 3: API & Tooling MVPImplement the API Gateway (@acme/api-gateway) using Fastify. Include the POST /v1/jobs endpoint (with Zod validation) to trigger the Master Orchestrator and a basic GET /v1/jobs/{jobId}/status endpoint.Implement the Tool Manager service (@acme/tool-manager) with a basic API structure.Implement one simple tool wrapper (e.g., a mock external API) with basic error handling.Phase 4: Memory MVPSet up the RAG Service (@acme/rag-service) structure.Integrate a Vector Database client and implement basic connection logic.Implement a placeholder retrieval endpoint.Phase 5: Enhancements & IntegrationImplement the Hybrid Planner logic (LLM + structured planning) in the Orchestrator.Implement the Adaptive Replanning logic based on agent feedback.Develop the Agent Capability Registry and integrate discovery logic into the Orchestrator.Implement more complex agents (e.g., Web Search Agent using Playwright).Implement the Secure Execution Sandbox service.Flesh out the RAG service logic (embedding, ingestion, retrieval).Implement Sub-Orchestrators if needed for workflow complexity.Integrate robust error handling, retries, and circuit breakers (especially Tool Manager, message consumers).Phase 6: Testing, Observability & Deployment PrepWrite comprehensive unit, integration, and E2E tests.Ensure full OpenTelemetry integration and test tracing/logging propagation.Develop Dockerfiles for all services.Create basic Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service).Specific Instructions & Considerations:Dependency Injection: Use dependency injection principles where appropriate (e.g., injecting message bus clients, RAG clients, logger instances) instead of direct instantiation within business logic (like the new MasterOrchestrator() example in the plan's API snippet - adapt that).Configuration: Manage configuration (API keys, DB URLs, service addresses) via environment variables (dotenv for local dev).Asynchronicity: Embrace asynchronous patterns (async/await) effectively, especially around I/O (message bus, DBs, APIs).Documentation: Write clear code comments (JSDoc style) for interfaces, public methods, and complex logic. Maintain README files for each package/service.Deliverables:A complete, runnable, and well-tested codebase organized in the specified monorepo structure.Dockerfile for each deployable service.Basic Kubernetes manifests (Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret examples) for deployment.Comprehensive test suites (unit, integration).README documentation for setup, running, testing, and deployment.Collaboration:Ask clarifying questions immediately if any part of the Technical Implementation Plan or Functional Requirements is unclear or seems contradictory.Provide regular updates on progress and potential blockers.Let's begin building this advanced AI system! Start with Phase 1: Foundation & Core Communication.



Here's the functional requirements 

Functional Requirements / User Stories: Manis-Inspired AI System1. IntroductionThis document outlines the functional requirements for the Manis-Inspired Autonomous AI System. It describes the intended capabilities and behaviors of the system from the perspective of different users and stakeholders. These requirements should guide the development process alongside the Technical Implementation Plan (manis_implementation_plan_v1). Requirements are primarily expressed as User Stories grouped by Epics.2. User PersonasEnd User: An individual or system submitting high-level goals to be accomplished by the AI system.System Operator: An individual responsible for monitoring the system's health, performance, and behavior, potentially intervening when necessary.Developer: An engineer integrating with the system via its API or extending its capabilities.Orchestrator: An internal system component (Master or Sub-Orchestrator) acting as a 'user' of agents and tools.Agent: An internal system component acting as a 'user' of tools and the memory system.3. Epics and User StoriesEpic: Goal Submission & ProcessingStory 1.1: As an End User, I want to submit a high-level goal described in natural language (e.g., "Analyze the impact of recent AI regulations on the healthcare sector") via a secure API endpoint, so that the system can autonomously plan and execute the necessary tasks to achieve the goal.Story 1.2: As an End User, I want to receive a unique Job ID upon successful goal submission, so that I can track the progress and retrieve the results later.Story 1.3: As a System Operator, I want the system (Master Orchestrator) to validate incoming goals for basic feasibility or clarity before initiating complex planning, so that obviously invalid requests are rejected early.Story 1.4: As an Orchestrator, I want to decompose a complex goal into a directed graph of smaller, logically connected sub-tasks using a hybrid planning approach (LLM + structured methods), so that the goal can be executed in manageable steps by specialized agents.Story 1.5: As an Orchestrator, I want to assign specific sub-tasks to appropriate agent types based on their registered capabilities, so that tasks are handled by the most suitable component.Epic: Task Execution & Agent CapabilitiesStory 2.1: As an Orchestrator, I want to dispatch TaskAssignment messages (containing task ID, description, parameters, dependencies, context) to agents via the message bus, so that agents can begin work asynchronously.Story 2.2: As an Agent, I want to subscribe to specific task queues/topics on the message bus relevant to my capabilities, so that I receive tasks assigned to me.Story 2.3: As an Agent, upon receiving a task, I want to send a StatusUpdate message (status: in-progress) via the message bus, so that the orchestrator and monitors know I have started working.Story 2.4: As an Agent (e.g., Web Search Agent), I want to perform web searches, navigate websites, and extract relevant information based on task parameters, so that I can fulfill research-oriented tasks.Story 2.5: As an Agent (e.g., Code Execution Agent), I want to execute provided code snippets (e.g., Python) within a secure sandbox environment, so that custom data processing, analysis, or simulations can be performed safely.Story 2.6: As an Agent, I want to generate structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logs detailing my reasoning process, actions taken, and intermediate findings during task execution, and send these as CoTLog messages via the message bus, so that my behavior is transparent and debuggable.Story 2.7: As an Agent, upon completing a task successfully, I want to send a StatusUpdate message (status: completed) including the task results via the message bus, so that the orchestrator receives the output.Story 2.8: As an Agent, if I fail to complete a task, I want to send a StatusUpdate message (status: failed) including error details via the message bus, so that the orchestrator is notified and can potentially replan.Story 2.9: As an Agent, I want to register my capabilities (e.g., web_search, python_execution, data_analysis:pandas) with the system (e.g., via a Capability Registry service or broadcast message), so that orchestrators know which tasks I can handle.Epic: Tool Integration & UsageStory 3.1: As an Agent, I want to request the execution of specific external tools (e.g., 'google_search_api', 'execute_python_script', 'database_query') via a standardized Tool Manager API, passing necessary parameters, so that I can leverage external capabilities without managing direct integrations.Story 3.2: As a System Operator, I want the Tool Manager to handle errors gracefully when interacting with external tools (e.g., implement retries, circuit breakers), so that transient tool failures do not necessarily cause task failure.Story 3.3: As a System Operator, I want code execution requested by agents to occur within a secure, resource-limited sandbox, so that system security and stability are maintained.Epic: Memory & Context Management (RAG)Story 4.1: As an Orchestrator, before generating a plan for a new goal, I want to query the RAG service with the goal description to retrieve summaries of relevant past jobs (successes, failures, key findings), so that planning can be informed by historical context.Story 4.2: As an Agent, before starting a complex task, I want to query the RAG service with my task description and initial context to retrieve relevant information (e.g., useful techniques from past CoT logs, relevant data snippets), so that I can perform my task more effectively and avoid known pitfalls.Story 4.3: As the System, I want completed task results and CoT logs to be processed and ingested into the RAG service's vector database asynchronously, so that future queries can benefit from this new information.Epic: Monitoring, Observability & Human InteractionStory 5.1: As a System Operator, I want to view a list of ongoing and completed jobs, including their overall status (e.g., running, completed, failed), via an API or dashboard, so that I can get an overview of system activity.Story 5.2: As a System Operator, I want to drill down into a specific job to see its task graph, the status of each task, and associated CoT logs, so that I can understand the detailed execution flow and diagnose issues.Story 5.3: As a System Operator, I want logs and traces from all system components (API, Orchestrators, Agents, Tools) to be correlated using Job IDs and Trace IDs, so that I can easily follow the entire lifecycle of a request across distributed services using observability tools (e.g., Jaeger, Grafana Loki).Story 5.4: As a System Operator, I want to configure alerts for critical events, such as high job failure rates, specific error types, or unresponsive agents, so that I can be proactively notified of problems.Story 5.5: As a System Operator, I want the ability to manually intervene in a specific job (e.g., pause, force-fail, resume, potentially provide corrective input for the next step), so that I can handle situations the autonomous system cannot resolve.Epic: API & System IntegrationStory 6.1: As a Developer, I want a well-documented (OpenAPI specification) and stable REST API for submitting goals, checking job status, retrieving results, and potentially accessing monitoring information, so that I can integrate the autonomous system into other applications or workflows.Story 6.2: As a Developer, I want the API to use standard authentication mechanisms (e.g., API Keys, JWT tokens), so that access can be controlled securely.4. Non-Functional Requirements (Highlights)Performance: The system should be able to handle a reasonable concurrent load of jobs (specific targets TBD). Task scheduling and execution should be efficient.Scalability: Individual components (especially Agents, Tool Manager, RAG Service) should be horizontally scalable to handle increased load.Reliability: The system should be resilient to transient failures in individual components or external tools. Use of message queues should ensure task persistence.Security: Sensitive data (API keys, user data) must be handled securely. Sandboxing for code execution is critical. Access control must be enforced.Maintainability: Code should be well-structured, documented, and testable, following the principles outlined in the technical plan.

tsconfig.base.json
Core Dependencies:TypeScript, ts-node, tsc-aliasESLint, Prettier (for code quality)Vitest or Jest (for testing)Zod (for schema validation, especially MCP)Pino (for structured logging)Dotenv (for environment configuration)Shared Packages:@acme/shared-mcp: Contains Zod schemas for all MCP message types and core TypeScript types. Crucially, this package defines the contract for inter-service communication.Example MCP Schemas (using Zod):import { z } from 'zod';

// Schema for task assignment messages.
export const TaskAssignmentSchema = z.object({
  jobId: z.string().uuid(), // Overall job identifier
  taskId: z.string().uuid(), // Unique ID for this specific task
  taskType: z.string(), // e.g., 'web_search', 'code_execute', 'data_analysis'
  description: z.string(),
  parameters: z.record(z.unknown()), // Task-specific parameters
  dependencies: z.array(z.string().uuid()).optional(), // IDs of tasks that must complete first
  context: z.record(z.unknown()).optional(), // Relevant context from orchestrator/RAG
});
export type TaskAssignment = z.infer<typeof TaskAssignmentSchema>;

// Schema for status updates.
export const StatusUpdateSchema = z.object({
  jobId: z.string().uuid(),
  taskId: z.string().uuid(),
  status: z.enum(['pending', 'queued', 'in-progress', 'completed', 'failed', 'retrying']),
  message: z.string().optional(), // Optional message, e.g., error details
  result: z.unknown().optional(), // Intermediate or final result data
  timestamp: z.string().datetime(),
});
export type StatusUpdate = z.infer<typeof StatusUpdateSchema>;

// Schema for chain-of-thought logs.
export const CoTLogSchema = z.object({
  jobId: z.string().uuid(),
  taskId: z.string().uuid(),
  agentId: z.string(),
  step: z.string(), // Description of the reasoning step or action
  details: z.record(z.unknown()).optional(), // Additional structured details
  timestamp: z.string().datetime(),
});
export type CoTLog = z.infer<typeof CoTLogSchema>;

// Schema for Agent Capability Registration
export const AgentCapabilitySchema = z.object({
    agentId: z.string(),
    capabilities: z.array(z.string()), // e.g., ['web_search', 'python_execution']
    timestamp: z.string().datetime(),
});
export type AgentCapability = z.infer<typeof AgentCapabilitySchema>;
@acme/shared-utils: Common logging setup (configuring Pino), custom error classes, utility functions (e.g., date formatting, retry logic helpers).3. Layer Implementation Details3.1 API & UI Layer (/packages/api-gateway)Framework: Fastify (chosen for high performance and good TypeScript support).API Specification: Define API using OpenAPI v3. Generate types/schemas from the spec.Key Endpoints:POST /v1/jobs: Submit a new high-level goal. Returns jobId.Input Validation Example (Fastify + Zod):import { FastifyInstance, FastifyRequest, FastifyReply } from 'fastify';
import { z } from 'zod';
import { MasterOrchestrator } from '../orchestrator-master/masterOrchestrator'; // Adjust path

const goalSchema = z.object({
  goal: z.string().min(10, { message: "Goal must be at least 10 characters" }),
  // Add other relevant parameters like user ID, priority, etc.
});

export default async function (fastify: FastifyInstance) {
  fastify.post('/v1/jobs', async (request: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) => {
    const validationResult = goalSchema.safeParse(request.body);
    if (!validationResult.success) {
      return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid input', details: validationResult.error.format() });
    }

    const { goal } = validationResult.data;
    const masterOrchestrator = new MasterOrchestrator(); // Get instance (dependency injection preferred)
    try {
      const jobId = await masterOrchestrator.processUserGoal(goal);
      reply.status(202).send({ jobId }); // Accepted for processing
    } catch (error: any) {
      fastify.log.error(error, `Error processing goal: ${goal}`);
      reply.status(500).send({ error: 'Internal server error' });
    }
  });
}
GET /v1/jobs/{jobId}/status: Get current status, progress, intermediate results.GET /v1/jobs/{jobId}/results: Get final results.POST /v1/jobs/{jobId}/feedback: Submit human feedback/intervention.WS /v1/jobs/{jobId}/stream: WebSocket endpoint for real-time status/log streaming.Authentication: fastify-jwt for securing endpoints.Real-time: Use fastify-websocket for status updates.UI (/packages/ui-dashboard - Optional): React/Vite/Tailwind CSS, communicating via REST/WebSocket.3.2 Orchestration Layer (/packages/orchestrator-master, /packages/orchestrator-sub)Framework: Node.js service (potentially using Fastify for internal health checks/APIs if needed).Hybrid Planner:LLM Integration: Use LangChain.js or direct SDKs (e.g., @openai/api, @anthropic-ai/sdk) for decomposition prompts. Structure prompts carefully to request step-by-step plans with dependencies, potentially outputting JSON conforming to a Task structure.Structured Planning: Implement custom logic for HTN/GOAP or integrate a library if available/suitable. This part might involve defining domain-specific actions and preconditions.Plan Validation: Implement functions to check plan graph for cycles, feasibility based on known agent capabilities (queried from registry), and resource constraints.Adaptive Replanning:Parse structured CoTLog and StatusUpdate (especially failed) messages using Zod schemas from @acme/shared-mcp.Implement state machines (e.g., using XState) to manage job/task lifecycles.Define logic to trigger replanning based on error types, agent feedback, or HitL input. Query RAG service for context during replanning.Communication: Use amqplib (RabbitMQ), kafkajs (Kafka), or nats.ws (NATS) client library to publish TaskAssignment messages and subscribe to StatusUpdate messages via the Message Bus. Use MCP schemas for message validation.3.3 Agent Subsystem (/packages/agent-*)Standard Agent Interface Example: All agents should ideally implement a common interface to ensure consistency.import { TaskAssignment, StatusUpdate, CoTLog } from '@acme/shared-mcp'; // Assuming MCP types are here

export interface IAgent {
  /**
   * Initializes the agent, connects to message bus, registers capabilities.
   */
  initialize(): Promise<void>;

  /**
   * Starts listening for tasks on the message bus.
   */
  start(): Promise<void>;

  /**
   * Handles an incoming task assignment. This is typically called by the message bus listener.
   * @param task The task assignment details.
   */
  handleTask(task: TaskAssignment): Promise<void>;

  /**
   * Performs the actual work for the task.
   * @param task The task assignment details.
   * @returns The result of the task execution.
   */
  executeTask(task: TaskAssignment): Promise<unknown>;

  /**
   * Sends a status update message via the message bus.
   * @param update The status update payload.
   */
  sendStatusUpdate(update: Omit<StatusUpdate, 'timestamp' | 'jobId' | 'taskId'>): Promise<void>; // Auto-fill common fields

  /**
   * Sends a Chain-of-Thought log message via the message bus.
   * @param log The CoT log payload.
   */
  sendCoTLog(log: Omit<CoTLog, 'timestamp' | 'jobId' | 'taskId' | 'agentId'>): Promise<void>; // Auto-fill common fields

  /**
   * Gracefully shuts down the agent.
   */
  shutdown(): Promise<void>;
}
Agent Service Template (/packages/agent-template):Basic Node.js service structure implementing IAgent.Includes Message Bus client setup (subscribing to assigned tasks queue/topic).Standardized handling of TaskAssignment messages, calling executeTask.Helper methods for sending StatusUpdate and structured CoTLog messages (automatically adding agent ID, timestamps, etc.).Integration with RAG service client (@acme/rag-client or similar).Capability registration logic (on startup, sending AgentCapability message or calling registry API).Capability Registry: Implement as a simple REST service (e.g., using Fastify) storing agent IDs and their advertised capabilities in memory or a simple DB (like Redis or Postgres). Orchestrators query this service. Alternatively, agents could broadcast capabilities on a dedicated message bus topic.MCP Implementation: Rigorously use Zod schemas from @acme/shared-mcp to parse incoming messages and validate outgoing ones.Example Agent (/packages/agent-websearch):Implements IAgent.executeTask method uses Playwright or Puppeteer for browser automation.Takes search queries/URLs as input via TaskAssignment.parameters.Performs web interaction, extracts data.Logs actions (e.g., "Navigating to URL", "Extracting text from selector") via sendCoTLog.Returns results via sendStatusUpdate (with status: 'completed' and result data). Handles errors by sending status: 'failed'.3.4 Tool Integration & Execution Layer (/packages/tool-manager, /packages/sandbox-service)Tool Manager Service (/packages/tool-manager):Provides a REST API (e.g., POST /v1/tools/{toolName}/execute) for agents to request tool execution.Manages tool definitions (API keys via secure config/secrets, endpoints, required parameters, input/output schemas).Implements standardized wrappers using a library like opossum for circuit breaking and retries around external API calls (e.g., Google Search API, database connections). Validates inputs/outputs against tool schemas.Secure Execution Sandbox Service (/packages/sandbox-service):Provides an API (e.g., POST /v1/execute/python) to run code snippets.Uses dockerode (Node.js Docker client) to:Pull a minimal base image (e.g., python:slim).Create a container with the code mounted or passed in.Set strict resource limits (--cpus, --memory, execution timeout, --network=none unless explicitly needed and allowed for specific tools).Execute the code.Capture stdout/stderr.Destroy the container promptly.Alternatively, use Wasm runtimes (wasmtime, wasmer-js) for potentially faster/lighter sandboxing if tools can be compiled to Wasm.3.5 Communication & Memory LayerMessage Bus Setup:RabbitMQ: Define exchanges (e.g., tasks, status, logs, capabilities), queues (e.g., agent.websearch.tasks, orchestrator.status), and bindings using amqplib. Use durable queues and persistent messages for critical tasks. Consider dead-letter exchanges for failed message handling.Kafka: Define topics (e.g., task_assignments, agent_status, agent_cot_logs, agent_capabilities) using kafkajs. Consider partitioning strategies based on jobId or agentType.Schema Registry: If using Kafka, integrate with Confluent Schema Registry or similar for robust schema evolution. For RabbitMQ/NATS, rely on Zod validation within services, potentially versioning schemas within the @acme/shared-mcp package.Intelligent Memory Module (/packages/rag-service):RAG Service:Provides an API (e.g., POST /v1/retrieve, POST /v1/ingest) for agents/orchestrators.Uses an embedding model (e.g., via @xenova/transformers locally or an API like OpenAI Embeddings, Cohere Embed).Connects to the Vector DB using its client library (e.g., @pinecone-database/pinecone, weaviate-ts-client).Implements logic to embed incoming queries and perform similarity searches (potentially filtering by jobId or task type).Handles ingestion of new CoT logs/results into the Vector DB asynchronously (e.g., via a dedicated message queue).Vector DB Choice: Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB, Milvus (choose based on scale, cloud vs. self-hosted needs, filtering capabilities).Other Stores: Use standard clients (ioredis, mongodb, pg) for cache (e.g., task states) and persistent logs/job metadata.3.6 Security, Monitoring & Feedback LayerSecurity:Implement JWT validation middleware in API Gateway and potentially internal service APIs (Tool Manager, RAG Service).Configure mTLS for inter-service communication where high security is needed (e.g., using Istio/Linkerd in Kubernetes or native library support). Secure API keys/secrets using a proper secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, cloud provider secrets managers).Observability:Integrate @opentelemetry/sdk-node in all services (using a shared configuration from @acme/shared-utils).Configure exporters (OTLP for Jaeger/Tempo/SigNoz, Prometheus).Instrument key libraries (Fastify, message bus clients, DB clients, HTTP clients) using OpenTelemetry instrumentation packages.Use pino for structured JSON logging, ensuring correlation IDs (trace IDs, span IDs, job IDs, task IDs) are automatically included in logs via async local storage or context propagation.HitL Interface:Backend API endpoints within the Master Orchestrator or a dedicated service to receive feedback (POST /v1/jobs/{jobId}/feedback).Logic to process feedback: pause/resume job, override next step, provide corrective data (which might update RAG context or trigger fine-tuning).4. Deployment & Infrastructure (/docker/, /infra/)Containerization: Create optimized multi-stage Dockerfiles for each service, ensuring non-root users and minimal dependencies.Orchestration: Use Kubernetes (EKS, GKE, AKS, or self-hosted).Define Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret manifests for each service. Use Ingress for the API Gateway.Manage secrets using Kubernetes Secrets, potentially synced from an external secrets manager.Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) for stateless services (API Gateway, Agents, RAG Service, Tool Manager).Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Use Terraform or Pulumi to provision cloud resources (Kubernetes cluster, databases, message bus, vector DB service).CI/CD: Set up pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) for:Linting & Static AnalysisUnit & Integration Testing (including using test containers)Building Docker imagesPushing images to a registry (Docker Hub, ECR, GCR)Deploying manifests to Kubernetes environments (dev, staging, prod) using tools like Helm or Kustomize.5. Testing StrategyUnit Tests: (Vitest/Jest) Test individual functions, classes, Zod schemas, validation logic within each service. Mock external dependencies (message bus, DBs, APIs). Aim for high coverage of core logic.Integration Tests: Test interactions between components within a service (e.g., API route handler -> service logic -> DB call). Use test containers (testcontainers-node) for databases/message buses. Test MCP message serialization/deserialization.End-to-End (E2E) Tests: Test full workflows by submitting a job via the API and verifying the final output and intermediate states (e.g., checking logs/status updates on the message bus or via status API). Requires deploying a test environment. Use tools like Playwright or Cypress for UI testing if applicable.Contract Testing: Use tools like Pact to verify interactions between services (e.g., Agent -> Tool Manager API) without full E2E deployment.Chaos Testing: Introduce failures (e.g., kill pods, inject latency, simulate API errors) in a staging environment to test resilience (circuit breakers, retries, replanning).6. ConclusionThis plan provides a concrete path forward for implementing the refined Manis-inspired architecture. Key success factors will be rigorous adherence to the MCP (enforced by shared schemas and validation), robust error handling at all levels, effective use of the RAG system for context, and comprehensive observability for debugging and monitoring the complex, distributed system. Start with core components (Orchestrator, MCP Schemas, Message Bus setup, simple Agent, RAG Service) and incrementally add complexity and features, focusing on testing at each stage.
